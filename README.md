# PublicTransit
Have you ever wondered; "Man, these warps are boring and immersion breaking, plus, they're overpowered!", then, worry no more!

PublicTransit brings you an in-rp method of slow, expensive transit, to both allow for better immersion, and also incentivise personal transport, rather than just teleporting around.
